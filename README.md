# CouchbaseLiteWrapper
### C++ wrapper for Couchbase Lite

Currently macOS/iOS only. 
Planned Windows / .NET compatibility. 

Possibly Android. However the author uses React Native and [ReactNativeCouchbaseLite](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/react-native-couchbase-lite) on mobile platforms so does not currently need to port the Android version. JNI is a pain so would rather not if its not needed!
